# About

EmerCall is a non-profit, Android-based project, developed to provide a fast, accurate communicative assistance system which can support the transportation process of victims in
emergency cases across Vietnam - my home country. Comprised of 3 Android applications, this system can allow civilians and hospitals to real-time acquire and update location
information of each other, as well as victimâ€™s status, in order to help the ambulances to approach their designated victims faster, while preparing for his/her current status. The
project is still under development, thus I sincerely hope to receive comments and suggestions from everyone.
